## My process

For this challenge I wanted to try Bootstrap and Sass (*bad idea*). I had a lot of trouble trying to override the default styles. The layout was easy, but customization was a headache.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I stil have **a lot** to learn, this is just the begining. I'll keep practising Bootstrap and Sass.

### Continued development
